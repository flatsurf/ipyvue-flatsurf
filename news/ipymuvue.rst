**Added:**

* <news item>

**Changed:**

* Changed JavaScript glue from ipyvue to ipyÎ¼vue. We are now using Vue 3 internally and also we do not need any explicit JavaScript glue code here anymore.

**Removed:**

* Removed support for the classic Jupyter notebook. We only support Jupyter Lab based notebooks (e.g., the retro notebook that will replace Jupyter notebook with version 7.)

**Fixed:**

* Fixed broken interaction with flow decompositions due to changes in sage-flatsurf.

* Fixed drawing of paths in Jupyter Lab.
