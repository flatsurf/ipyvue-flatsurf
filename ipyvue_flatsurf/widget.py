r"""
Provide widgets for flatsurf.

This module provides a generic `Widget` command to create a Jupyter Widget for
the various objects in flatsurf, pyflatsurf, and sage-flatsurf. It also sets
display hooks so these widgets are shown automatically in Jupyter Notebooks.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces, polygons, similarity_surfaces
    >>> t = polygons.triangle(1, 1, 1)
    >>> B = similarity_surfaces.billiard(t)
    >>> S = B.minimal_cover('translation')

This module provides an explicit `Widget` command to create a widget::

    >>> from ipyvue_flatsurf.widget import Widget
    >>> Widget(S)
    TranslationSurfaceWidget(...)
