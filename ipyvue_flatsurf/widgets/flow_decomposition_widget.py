r"""
A Jupyter Widget for a sage-flatsurf Flow Decomposition.

EXAMPLES:

    >>> from flatsurf.geometry.similarity_surface_generators import TranslationSurfaceGenerators
    >>> S = TranslationSurfaceGenerators.square_torus()

    >>> from flatsurf import GL2ROrbitClosure
    >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(S)
    >>> D = next(O.decompositions(bound=64))
    >>> FlowDecompositionWidget(D)
    FlowDecompositionWidget(...)

Typically, this module is not used directly, but the widget created through the
`Widget` helper::

    >>> from ipyvue_flatsurf import Widget
    >>> Widget(D)
    FlowDecompositionWidget(...)
