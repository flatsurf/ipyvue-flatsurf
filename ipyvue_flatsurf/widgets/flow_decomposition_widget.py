A Jupyter Widget for a sage-flatsurf Flow Decomposition.

EXAMPLES:

    >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces, GL2ROrbitClosure
    >>> S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
    >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(S)
    >>> D = next(O.decompositions(bound=64))
    >>> FlowDecompositionWidget(D)
    FlowDecompositionWidget(...)

Typically, this module is not used directly, but the widget created through the
`Widget` helper::

    >>> from ipyvue_flatsurf import Widget
    >>> Widget(D)
    FlowDecompositionWidget(...)

We can also pull back components through a deformation such as the one that is
eliminating marked points::

    >>> from flatsurf import polygons, similarity_surfaces, GL2ROrbitClosure
    >>> from flatsurf.geometry.pyflatsurf_conversion import to_pyflatsurf
    >>> t = polygons.triangle(1, 1, 1)
    >>> B = similarity_surfaces.billiard(t)
    >>> S = B.minimal_cover('translation')
    >>> deformation = to_pyflatsurf(S).eliminateMarkedPoints()
    >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(deformation.codomain())
    >>> D = next(O.decompositions(bound=64))
    >>> FlowDecompositionWidget(D, deformation=deformation.section())
    FlowDecompositionWidget(...)

::

    >>> Widget(D, deformation=deformation.section())
    FlowDecompositionWidget(...)
