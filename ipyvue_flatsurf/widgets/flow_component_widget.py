r"""
A Jupyter Widget for one or several sage-flatsurf Flow Components.

EXAMPLES:

    >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces, GL2ROrbitClosure
    >>> S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
    >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(S)
    >>> D = next(O.decompositions(bound=64))
    >>> components = D.decomposition.components()
    >>> FlowComponentWidget(list(components))
    FlowComponentWidget...)

Typically, this module is not used directly, but the widget created through the
`Widget` helper::

    >>> from ipyvue_flatsurf import Widget
    >>> Widget(components)
    FlowComponentWidget(...)
