A Jupyter Widget for a flatsurf Flat Triangulation.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces
    >>> S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
    >>> from flatsurf.geometry.pyflatsurf_conversion import to_pyflatsurf
    >>> S = to_pyflatsurf(S)
    >>> FlatTriangulationWidget(S)
    FlatTriangulationWidget(...)

Typically, this module is not used directly, but the widget created through the
`Widget` helper::

    >>> from ipyvue_flatsurf import Widget
    >>> Widget(S)
    FlatTriangulationWidget(...)
