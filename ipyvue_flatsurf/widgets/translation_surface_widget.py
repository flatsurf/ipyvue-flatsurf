A Jupyter Widget for a sage-flatsurf Translation Surface.

EXAMPLES:

    >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces
    >>> S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
    >>> TranslationSurfaceWidget(S)
    TranslationSurfaceWidget(...)

Typically, this module is not used directly, but the widget created through the
`Widget` helper::

    >>> from ipyvue_flatsurf import Widget
    >>> Widget(S)
    TranslationSurfaceWidget(...)
