Jupyter Widgets for flatsurf.

This package adds display hooks for some of the objects in flatsurf, pyflatsurf,
and sage-flatsurf.

EXAMPLES:

Importing this module adds display hooks::

    >>> import ipyvue_flatsurf

They get called automatically if a cell ends with such an object::

    >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces
    >>> S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
    >>> S
    TranslationSurface built from 1 polygon

Running the above in a Jupyter notebook calls the `_ipython_display_` hook and
displays an actual widget instead::

    >>> S._ipython_display_()
    {...}
