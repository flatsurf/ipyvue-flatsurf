def encode_flow_component(component, deformation=None):
    r"""
    Return the flow component encoded as a primitive type.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurf import translation_surfaces, GL2ROrbitClosure
        >>> S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
        >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(S)

    Using a deformation, a flow component can also be pulled back from a
    deformed surface::

        >>> t = polygons.triangle(1, 1, 1)

        >>> S = B.minimal_cover('translation')
        >>> deformation = to_pyflatsurf(S).eliminateMarkedPoints()
        >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(deformation.codomain())

        This is a sequence of saddle connections that make up the perimeter of
