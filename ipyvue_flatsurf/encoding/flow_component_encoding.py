        The relevant perimeter of this component.

        This is a sequence of saddle connections that make up the perimeter of
        this component. Non-cylinders often contain lots of saddle connections
        that were created by the Rauzy induction but are just internal to the
        component, i.e., the component is on both sides of the connection.

        We exclude such connections since they are usually of no interest.

        TODO: This is maybe not the right thing to do for non-cylinders. In
        particular, this breaks when there is only one minimal or
        undetermined component as this excludes everything. See
