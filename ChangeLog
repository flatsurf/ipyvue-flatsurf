ipyvue-flatsurf Change Log
==========================

.. current developments

v0.5.0
====================

**Changed:**

* Cleaned up the implementation quite a bit. Mostly, by properly separating
  different visualizations. They are all still available as `Widget` but this
  then dispatches to the actual implementation classes.
  Note that the old `FlatSurface` class is gone.
* Upgrade to vue-flatsurf 0.9.0 which brings lots of new features. However,
  some features such as setting a glueing from the outside have not been
  migrated yet.
* We now depend on ipyvue-async to make blocking asynchronous calls into the
  Widget in Jupyter Notebooks.



v0.4.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added SVG export, an example is in the `billiards` notebook.



v0.3.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Compatibility with Python 3.7



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Binder link to README.

**Changed:**

* Releases are now created on flatsurf/ipyvue-flatsurf and not on saraedum/ipyvue-flatsurf anymore.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed description text in setup.py and on PyPI.



v0.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* Visualization for an individual flow component.
* Expose `inner` half edges, i.e., those that are visually glued.

* Allow forcing half edges to be visually glued, see `examples/glueings.ipynb`.
* Example notebook for visualization of cylinders in orthogonal directions.

**Fixed:**

* Fix shading of flow components. Sometimes bits of a flow component that was completely inside a face had been missing.
* Do not show inner structure of minimal components but only the boundary of such components.



v1.0.0
====================
