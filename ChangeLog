v0.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* Visualization for an individual flow component.
* Expose `inner` half edges, i.e., those that are visually glued.

* Allow forcing half edges to be visually glued, see `examples/glueings.ipynb`.
* Example notebook for visualization of cylinders in orthogonal directions.

**Fixed:**

* Fix shading of flow components. Sometimes bits of a flow component that was completely inside a face had been missing.
* Do not show inner structure of minimal components but only the boundary of such components.



v1.0.0
